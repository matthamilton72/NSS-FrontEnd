    <h2>Biography</h2>
    <p>
      I wrestled a <em>bear</em> once. A 750lbs black bear. Have you urinated? Have you <em>drained</em> your bladder? Are you free? Because if you havent it will only come out later. I'm giving you some information that your <strong>bodily fluids</strong> may penetrate your clothing fibre's without warning. <abbr title="What the Frick">WTF</abbr>?!?
    </p>

      Its like a symbology of this of your mouth is eating food, from your mouth to your heart, is your freedom and your independence and your identity. Go with the feeling of the nature. Take it easy. Know why you're here. And remeber to balance your internal energy with the environment.

      The magic Indian is a mysterious spiritual force, and we're going to Cathedral Rock, and that's the vortex of the heart. Thats an advanced modern oxymoron. It was good, I like it and I beleived it. Man you got a way with using words. Thats like a lariat that does a snake whip on your back legs, I mean on the back of your legs - not that you have 4 legs - and pulls you this way, and thats what that line did to me and I believed every minute of it. Until I looked at the quadrangle that it produced with the verbs used in the sentence.

      Never dip lower than you can dip. Sometimes horses cough and fart at the same time, so stay out of the range of its butt muscle because a horses butt muscle is thick. It's good to yell at people and tell people that you're from Tennesee, so that way you'll be safe.
